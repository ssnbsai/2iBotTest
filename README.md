1. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. **Install TypeScript Globally:**
   Open a terminal and run the following command to install TypeScript globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

3. **Create a TypeScript File:**
   Create a new TypeScript file, let's say `main.ts`, and paste the TypeScript code into it.

4. **Initialize a TypeScript Configuration File:**
   Run the following command in the terminal to initialize a `tsconfig.json` file. This file provides configuration options for the TypeScript compiler.

   ```bash
   tsc --init
   ```

5. **Compile TypeScript Code:**
   Run the following command to compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript:

   ```bash
   tsc
   ```

6. **Open Visual Studio Code:**
   Open a new Visual Studio Code window by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

7. **Run the JavaScript Code:**
   You can now run the JavaScript code using Node.js. In the terminal, run:
   ```bash
   node test.js
   ```

This sequence of steps assumes that you have Node.js, npm, and TypeScript installed globally on your machine.
